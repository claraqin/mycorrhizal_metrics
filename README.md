Comparison of Mycorrhizal Intensity Metrics
=========

# Background

I am particularly interested in comparing these two metrics.

1. _%EM_ (or _%AM_) - the percent of forest basal area occupied by trees that are associated primarily with ectomycorrhizal (or arbuscular mycorhizal) fungi in a given site.
2. Intensity of mycorrhizal infection - as quantified by methods of Ivan Aleksandrovich Selivanov and described by [Akhmetzhanova _et al._](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E093/059/metadata.htm)

_%EM_ is based on site-level tree characteristics and can therefore be collected relatively easily, whereas intensity of mycorrhizal infection is based on belowground root sampling and therefore requires additional sampling effort.

If _%EM_ and intensity of mycorrhizal infection have a close relationship, then we may conclude that _%EM_ is a sufficient proxy for mycorrhizal infection.

# Analysis

Load mycorrhizal intensity datasets from [Akhmetzhanova _et al._](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E093/059/metadata.htm):


```r
myco <- read.csv("data/sovietunion_myco.csv", header=TRUE) # original name: Myco_db.csv
sites <- read.csv("data/sovietunion_sites.csv", header=TRUE) # original name: Sites.csv
```

Note: I added the _percent.em.trees_ column based on a dataset of tree mycorrhizal associations from Kabir Peay.

See Appendix for dataset schema descriptions.

Clean values for _%EM_:

```r
sites$percent.em.trees <- as.numeric(as.character(sites$percent.em.trees))
```

Combine myco and site datasets:


```r
myco %>%
  filter(mycorrhizal.type.modern=="Ectomycorrhiza ") %>%
  left_join(sites, by=c("site.number"="site")) -> em_sites
```

Plot intensity of ectomycorrhizal infection vs. %EM:


```r
em_sites %>%
  filter(!is.na(percent.em.trees)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=percent.em.trees, y=intensity.of.mycorrhizal.infection, group=percent.em.trees)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```
## Warning: Removed 13 rows containing non-finite values (stat_boxplot).
```

Doesn't look so good.

No. of records per %EM level:


```r
em_sites %>%
  group_by(percent.em.trees) %>%
  summarise(n_records = n())
```

```
## # A tibble: 4 x 2
##   percent.em.trees n_records
##              <dbl>     <int>
## 1                0         7
## 2               90         6
## 3              100        92
## 4               NA       541
```

Next steps: Account for mycorrhizal type of the plant from which roots were sampled.

* AM: arbuscular mycorrhiza
* Arbutoid: arbutoid mycorrhiza
* Ectomycorrhiza: ectomycorrhiza
* Endo-unidentified: non-parasitic fungi found in the root tissue. However they do not create any known type of endo-mycorrhiza
* Ericoid: ericoid mycorrhiza
* DS: dark septate endophyte mycorrhiza
* Orchid: orchid mycorrhiza
* No: non-mycorrhizal plant
* Site number: number of a site where the plant material was collected. The field can have values from 1 to 154. For detailed site description see file sites.txt

Intensity of mycorrhizal infection: value of intensity of mycorrhizal infection measured by the team of Selivanov, ranging from 1 to 100. For the methods to detect the intensity of mycorrhizal infection see under Methods.

Literature data on presence-absence of mycorrhiza: this field is empty for the species-site combinations where the group of Selivanov measured mycorrhizal intensity

"+": indicates that according to the appendix in the thesis of Selivanov (1976) the species was reported in Russian literature as possessing the given type of mycorrhiza at given site

"-": indicates that, according to the appendix in the thesis of Selivanov (1976), in Russian literature the species was reported as non-mycorrhizal at given site

Range of mycorrhizal intensity MIN and Range of mycorrhizal intensity MAX: minimum and maximum values of mycorrhizal intensity measured by Selivanov and his team (when available)
